// Package llm is a call to a model: what a model is asked, what it answers, and
// the shape an answer is stored in. Providers are data: the catalog package
// lists them, and the app hands them to New.
//
// Files are grouped by prefix: dialect_*.go speaks one wire, as the function
// Target.Stream calls for that dialect, and those and helpers.go are the only
// files of the package that import a model SDK.
package llm

// Dialect is the wire a provider is spoken to on, named for the API and never
// the vendor: a platform serves the same wire as the vendor that defined it.
