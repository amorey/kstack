//! What the host does with the sidecar's pipes.
//!
//! The sidecar writes its own `sidecar.log`, so the pipes are not the log any
//! more. What arrives here is re-emitted as an event of the host's own, at the
//! level the record names: the host then stamps, levels, filters and renders
//! both processes the same way, and a terminal orders them by one clock rather
//! than racing two.
//!
//! Where the event goes is the file layer's decision, not this module's
//! (`logging::is_host_log`): a debug build's pipes carry the whole log that
//! `sidecar.log` already holds, and only a release build's panics reach
//! `main.log`.
